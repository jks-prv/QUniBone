 Implementation of QBUS/UNIBUS devices:

 A device is a piece of hardware with internal logic and a set of QBUS/UNIBUS registers.
 Device logic is implemented by ARM code as Linux user process.

 Device registers are dual ported:
 - used by ARM device logic.
 - accessed over QBUS/UNIBUS with DATI/DATO cycles.

 Two types of registers:
 - Some "passive" registers are simply memory cells, DATI/DATO does not change device logic state.
 - "active" registers trigger logic state changes (Example "GO" and CMD bit in TM11).

 Problem: if QBUS/UNIBUS accesses a  "hot" register
 - value must be read/written within 10us (QBUS/UNIBUS timeout)
 - a signal to ARM logic is generated. This causes Linux process context switch and further processing
 This must be completed before next QBUS/UNIBUS access to same device, but can take
 infinite time.
 Solution: MSYN-assert to SSYN-assert time must be fast, else timeout.
 At end of cycle MSYN-negate to SSYN-negate can be slow.
 -> keep SSYN asserted until ARM logic complete

 Events:
 PRU generated for certain register acccess an  event "afterread" or "afterwrite".

 In detail: if a iopage register is "hot":
 QBUS/UNIBUS - READ (PRU)
 on SSYN assert: return "value" field, (fast and uncoditionally)
 raise "AfterDATI"
 wait until ARM clears event (ACK)
 wait until MSYN is negate /much much faster than ARM completes
 negate SSYN

 Logic-READ (ARM)
 - wait in eventhtread until event is raised
 - get register, controller and DATI flag
 - route event to controller
 - change controller state, write new values into register set.
 - perhaps schedule DMA and INTR

 QBUS/UNIBUS-WRITE (PRU)
 MSYN asserted
 immediately copy value into register.value, assert SSYN
 raise "AFTER-DATO" event
 wait until ARM clears event (ACK)
 wait until MSYN is negated /much much faster than ARM completes
 negate SSYN


 Logic-WRITE
 wait in event thread until event is raised
 get register, controller and DATI/O flag
 route event to controller
 change controller state, write new values into register set.
 perhaps do DMA and INTR
